Problem 1:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|} 
\hline
Number of Variables & Median Running Time (s) & Average bit flips \\ 
20 & 41.994 & 109566 \\
50 & 299.201 & 761892 \\
75 & 681.720 & 1621230 \\
100 & 981.720 & 3117231 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The number of variables in each instance has a strong effect on the median running time and average bit flips performed. For the 20 variable problems, the comupter would solve 50 of them in just a couple on minutes. As we tested the 50 and 75 variable problems, the average time per problem increased significantly, as did the amount of bit flips. The time and bit flips were almost 7 times higher for the 50 variable problems, and 16 times higher for the 75 variable problems. Finally, the 100 variable problems took so much time to run, that we had to test them separately instead of all together like the others. They were almost 20 times higher in median running time and bit flips. \\\medskip
The performance becomes much slower with more variables in the problem because the computer has to store and evaluate many more values. The bit flip amount increased significantly because each one of the variables would contribute to extra bit flips every cycle. Finally, the amount of clauses increased as the amount of variables increased, so evaluating all of them became much more time consuming.\\\medskip
